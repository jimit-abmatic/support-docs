### Understanding the Campaign Table

| Column | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Campaign Name** | Campaign title and type (Inbound/Outbound/etc.) |
| **Preference** | Priority ranking—when a visitor matches multiple campaigns, highest preference wins |
| **Status** | Current state: Full personalization, Experiment, or Inactive |
| **Unique Visitors** | How many people saw personalized content vs. control group |
| **Created/Updated** | Timeline for tracking changes |

### Status Types Explained

| Status | What It Means | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **100% Full Personalization** | All matching visitors see personalized content | After validating a winning variation |
| **50% Experiment** | A/B test running—half see personalized, half see original | When testing new messaging |
| **0% Inactive** | Campaign is paused | During setup or when taking a break |

### Reading Visitor Metrics

The **Unique Visitors** column shows your campaign's reach:

- **First number**: Visitors who saw personalized content
- **"vs X in control"**: Visitors who saw the original page

**Example:** "422 vs 437 in control" means:
- 422 visitors experienced your personalization
- 437 visitors served as your control group
- You can now compare conversion rates to measure true impact

### Priority System (Preference)

When a visitor qualifies for multiple campaigns, **Preference** determines what they see:

| Preference | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **#1** | Always wins when matched |
| **#2** | Shows only if visitor doesn't match #1 |
| **#3, #4...** | Falls through in order |

**Pro tip:** Put your highest-value campaigns (like competitor blocking or top accounts) at Preference #1.
