## Website Personalization

Turn your one-size-fits-all website into a conversion machine that speaks directly to each visitor's needs.

### Show Industry-Specific Content

**The Challenge:**
Your website uses generic messaging that fails to resonate with different industries. A healthcare executive and a tech startup founder see the same homepage, even though their pain points and priorities are completely different.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Navigate to **Campaigns** and create a new website personalization campaign
2. Set targeting criteria: `Industry = Healthcare`
3. Customize your homepage headline, featured case studies, and CTAs specifically for healthcare
4. Create additional variations for your other key verticals (technology, financial services, manufacturing, etc.)

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **15-30% increase** in engagement from targeted industries
- **Higher conversion rates** as visitors see relevant content immediately
- **Faster sales cycles** when prospects already understand your industry expertise

### Personalize for Named Accounts

**The Challenge:**
Your sales team is pursuing 50 high-value enterprise accounts, but when decision-makers visit your website, they see the same generic experience as everyone else—missing a critical opportunity to impress.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Import your target account list into Abmatic via CSV or CRM sync
2. Create an outbound personalization campaign targeting these accounts
3. Customize messaging by account tier—enterprise accounts see different content than mid-market
4. Include company name tokens, relevant case studies, and personalized CTAs

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **VIP experience** for your most valuable prospects
- **Sales enablement** through custom landing pages that support outreach
- **Higher engagement** from accounts that feel personally addressed

## Company Identification (Reveal)

Stop guessing who's visiting your website. Reveal turns anonymous traffic into actionable sales intelligence.

### See Who's Visiting Your Website

**The Challenge:**
Google Analytics tells you 1,000 companies visited your website last month, but you have no idea which ones. Your sales team is essentially flying blind.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Install the Abmatic tracking script (one-time, 5-minute setup)
2. Navigate to **Reveal** > **Accounts** to see identified companies in real-time
3. Filter by industry, company size, location, or pages visited
4. Prioritize outreach to high-fit companies showing genuine interest

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Complete visibility** into your anonymous website traffic
- **Prioritized outreach** based on actual visitor behavior
- **Faster response times** to warm accounts already researching solutions

### Identify High-Intent Accounts

**The Challenge:**
Not all website visitors are created equal. You need to separate serious buyers from casual browsers, but behavior data is siloed and hard to act on.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Create a filter: `Total Page Views > 5 AND Visited Pages contains "pricing"`
2. Save this as a "High Intent" target group for ongoing monitoring
3. Configure Slack notifications for new high-intent accounts
4. Route these accounts directly to your sales team for immediate follow-up

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Real-time alerts** when hot accounts show buying signals
- **Sales focus** on accounts most likely to convert
- **Minutes, not days** between intent signal and sales outreach

## CRM Integration

### Enrich Salesforce with Visitor Data

**The Challenge:**
Your Salesforce accounts are missing critical data points like industry, employee count, and recent website activity. Reps waste time researching accounts instead of selling.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Connect Salesforce to Abmatic from **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Configure field mapping for firmographic fields (industry, size, revenue, etc.)
3. Enable bidirectional sync from Abmatic to Salesforce
4. Use **Fill mode** to enrich existing records without overwriting manual updates

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Complete firmographic data** on every account—automatically
- **Website activity visible in Salesforce** for sales context
- **Better segmentation** and prioritization without manual data entry

### Create Accounts from Website Visitors

**The Challenge:**
High-fit companies visit your website daily, but they don't exist in your CRM. Without a way to capture them, these opportunities slip through the cracks.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. In **Reveal** > **Accounts**, filter for companies not yet in your CRM
2. Further filter by ICP criteria (right size, industry, location)
3. Select matching accounts and click **Push to CRM**
4. Assign to the appropriate sales rep or marketing nurture track

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **New target accounts** automatically added to your CRM
- **Zero missed opportunities** from website visits
- **Clean handoffs** between marketing and sales with full context

## Advertising Campaigns

Make every ad dollar count by targeting only the accounts that matter.

### Target Accounts on LinkedIn

**The Challenge:**
You're investing in LinkedIn ads, but you're reaching random people instead of decision-makers at your target accounts. Your cost per qualified lead is too high.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Build or import your target account list in Abmatic
2. Create a LinkedIn Ads campaign from the campaigns page
3. Push your account list to LinkedIn as a matched audience
4. Run sponsored content targeting only those specific accounts

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Focused ad spend** on accounts that actually matter
- **Higher ROI** from surgically targeted reach
- **Consistent messaging** across your website and paid channels

### Retarget Website Visitors with Display Ads

**The Challenge:**
Accounts visit your website, browse your content, and then disappear. Without retargeting, you lose top-of-mind awareness to competitors.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Create an audience of accounts with recent website visits in the last 30 days
2. Push this audience to Google Ads via Customer Match
3. Run display retargeting campaigns to stay visible
4. Personalize ad messaging based on the pages they viewed

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Stay visible** to accounts already showing interest
- **Re-engage visitors** who didn't convert on their first visit
- **Lower CAC** compared to cold advertising

### Track Campaign Influence on Pipeline

**The Challenge:**
You're running personalization campaigns and ABM programs, but you can't demonstrate their impact on revenue. Leadership wants proof before approving more budget.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Set up conversion goals in Abmatic (demo requests, trials, contact form submissions)
2. Connect your CRM with opportunity sync enabled
3. View campaign analytics showing influenced pipeline and revenue
4. Report on accounts touched by campaigns that became opportunities

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Clear attribution** from campaign to pipeline to closed-won revenue
- **Data to justify** continued marketing investment
- **Insight into which campaigns** actually drive business outcomes

### A/B Test Personalization

**The Challenge:**
You believe personalization works, but you need quantitative proof before rolling it out across your entire site. Stakeholders want to see the numbers.

**The Abmatic Solution:**
1. Create a personalization campaign with a 30% control group (no personalization)
2. Run the experiment for 2-4 weeks to gather statistically significant data
3. Compare conversion rates between personalized and control experiences
4. Calculate lift and statistical significance

**What Success Looks Like:**
- **Quantified impact** of personalization on key metrics
- **Data-driven decisions** on what to scale and what to iterate
- **Stakeholder buy-in** backed by hard numbers
