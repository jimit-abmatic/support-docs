# Visitor Tracking Overview

**Turn anonymous website traffic into qualified pipeline.** Abmatic AI's visitor tracking identifies companies and contacts visiting your website in real-time—even when they never fill out a form. Stop guessing who's interested and start engaging prospects at the first sign of buying intent.

## Why Visitor Intelligence Matters

Most B2B websites convert less than 2% of visitors. The other 98%? They leave without a trace—taking their buying intent with them. Abmatic changes that.

| Without Visitor Tracking | With Abmatic Visitor Reveal |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 98% of visitors leave anonymous | Identify companies behind every visit |
| Miss buying intent signals | See which accounts are actively researching |
| React only to form fills | Engage prospects at first sign of interest |
| No context for sales outreach | Rich company and contact data for personalization |
| Blind spots in your funnel | Complete visibility into website engagement |

**The result:** Sales teams focus on accounts already showing interest, marketing personalizes experiences in real-time, and pipeline grows faster.

## How It Works

When a visitor lands on your website with the Abmatic tracking script installed:

```
Visitor arrives → IP analysis → Company identified → Behavior tracked → Data enriched → Ready for action
```

1. **IP-Based Company Identification** — We analyze the visitor's IP address against our database of 40M+ companies to identify who's visiting
2. **Real-Time Enrichment** — Company details (industry, size, revenue, location) are automatically populated
3. **Behavioral Tracking** — Page views, time on site, scroll depth, and engagement patterns are captured
4. **Contact Discovery** — When visitors submit forms or match known contacts, we associate individuals with companies
5. **Engagement Scoring** — Automatic scoring based on visit frequency, pages viewed, and content engagement

## Understanding Confidence Levels

Company identification includes a confidence score to help you prioritize outreach:

| Confidence | Score Range | What It Means | Action |
|------------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Very High** | 71-100% | Direct match from enterprise IP range | Prioritize for immediate outreach |
| **High** | 51-70% | Strong indicators with high certainty | Include in target account lists |
| **Moderate** | 31-50% | Good match with some uncertainty | Verify with additional signals |
| **Low** | 21-30% | Possible match, verify before outreach | Use for awareness campaigns |
| **Very Low** | 6-20% | Weak signals, use with caution | Monitor for additional activity |

**Pro tip:** Focus outreach on High and Very High confidence matches for best results. Use Moderate matches in advertising campaigns where broader reach is acceptable.
