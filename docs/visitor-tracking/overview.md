# Visitor Tracking Overview

Abmatic AI's visitor tracking identifies companies and contacts visiting your website in real-time, enabling you to understand who's engaging with your content and personalize their experience.

## How It Works

When a visitor lands on your website with the Abmatic tracking script installed:

1. **IP-Based Company Identification** - We analyze the visitor's IP address to identify their company
2. **Behavioral Tracking** - We capture page views, time on site, and engagement metrics
3. **Contact Reveal** - When visitors submit forms or identify themselves, we associate the contact with the company

## Key Features
