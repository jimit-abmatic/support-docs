# Contact Reveal

Contact Reveal identifies individual people at companies visiting your website, giving you specific contacts to reach out to.

## How Contact Reveal Works

Contact reveal uses multiple data sources to identify visitors:

1. Form submissions on your website
2. Email link clicks (from marketing emails)
3. IP-based identification combined with contact databases

## Viewing Revealed Contacts

Navigate to **Reveal** > **Contacts** to see identified contacts.
