# Company Identification

Abmatic AI uses IP-based company identification to reveal which companies are visiting your website, even when visitors don't fill out forms.

## How Company Identification Works

1. A visitor arrives at your website
2. Abmatic captures their IP address
3. We match the IP against our company database
4. Company information is associated with the visit

## Viewing Revealed Companies

Navigate to **Reveal** > **Accounts** to see companies visiting your site.
