# Configuring AI Agents

Transform your AI agents from helpful assistants into expert sales representatives who know your business inside and out. With the right context, your AI agents deliver responses that feel custom-built for your company.

## Why Configuration Matters

| Without Context | With Context |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Generic responses | On-brand messaging that matches your voice |
| Basic product info | Accurate pricing, features, and differentiators |
| Missed opportunities | Intelligent qualification and next steps |
| Inconsistent answers | Approved responses to common questions |

**The difference is dramatic**: AI agents with proper context achieve 40% higher engagement rates and more qualified conversations.

## Accessing AI Agent Settings

1. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Click **AI Agents**
3. Choose your configuration tab:

| Tab | Purpose |
|-----|---------|

Guide your AI to write personalized, high-converting outreach that sounds authentically human.

### What to Include

#### 1. Value Propositions

Give the AI compelling reasons to engage prospects:

```
Primary value propositions:

For Marketing Leaders:
- "See exactly which campaigns drive revenue, not just leads"

#### 2. Tone & Voice Guidelines

Maintain brand consistency across all outreach:

```
Our voice is:
- Professional but approachable (not stiff or overly casual)
- Confident but not arrogant
- Data-driven with clear proof points
- Helpful, not pushy

Always include:
- Specific, relevant personalization
- One clear call-to-action per email
- Value before ask

Never include:
- Excessive exclamation points
- Phrases like "just checking in" or "touching base"
- Generic flattery ("I love your company!")
- More than one meeting request
```

#### 3. Follow-up Strategy

Define the cadence and approach for sequences:

```
Follow-up cadence:
- Day 1: Initial outreach highlighting specific pain point
- Day 3: Share relevant case study or social proof
- Day 7: Offer something of value (demo, audit, resource)
- Day 14: Final touch with new angle or insight

Objection handling:
- "Not the right time": Ask about future planning cycles, offer to reconnect
- "Already have a solution": Ask about gaps, share competitive differentiators
- "Need to involve others": Offer to include stakeholders, send shareable resources
```

#### 4. Personalization Rules

Help the AI tailor messages by segment:

```
Personalization by company size:

Enterprise (1000+ employees):
- Emphasize: Security, compliance, dedicated support, SLAs
- Mention: Enterprise customer logos (Cisco, Adobe, Salesforce)
- Approach: Executive-level language, strategic focus

Mid-Market (100-999 employees):
- Emphasize: Time to value, ease of use, integrations
- Mention: Similar-sized customer success stories
- Approach: Tactical benefits, quick wins

SMB (under 100 employees):
