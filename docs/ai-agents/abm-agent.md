## Best Practices

### Do's

| Practice | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Be specific with criteria** | "Technology companies with 500+ employees" gets better results than "big tech companies" |
| **Include geography** | Clara can target precisely when you specify regions |
| **Mention engagement levels** | "High engagement" or "viewed pricing page" adds behavioral targeting |
| **Ask for analysis** | Clara can explain trends and recommend actions |

### Don'ts

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Vague requests | "Get me some leads" is too broad for Clara to act on |
| Multiple unrelated tasks | Focus on one request at a time for best results |
| Skipping review | Always review Clara's output before activating campaigns |

## Real-World Workflows

**Marketing Manager:** "I need to target our Q1 pipeline accounts who haven't engaged in 30 days"

**Clara:** Creates an account list filtering for Q1 opportunities with no recent page views, then suggests a re-engagement campaign with personalized messaging based on their last interaction.

---

**Demand Gen Lead:** "What's working in our enterprise campaigns this quarter?"

**Clara:** Pulls performance data across all enterprise-targeted campaigns, identifies top performers, and recommends reallocating budget to highest-converting segments.

---

**ABM Specialist:** "Create a nurture campaign for accounts that downloaded our ROI guide"

**Clara:** Builds an audience of guide downloaders, creates a campaign with relevant follow-up content, and suggests personalization rules based on their industry.

## Metrics to Track

Monitor Clara's impact with these KPIs:

| Metric | What to Measure |
|--------|-----------------|

## Troubleshooting

**Clara doesn't understand my request**
