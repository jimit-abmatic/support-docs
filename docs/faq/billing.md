## Plans & Pricing

### How is Abmatic priced?

Abmatic uses transparent, usage-based pricing that grows with your business:

| Pricing Factor | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Identified Companies** | Unique companies identified on your site each month | Pay only for valuable B2B visitors, not all traffic |
| **Features** | Capabilities included in your plan tier | Choose the features that match your needs |
| **Users** | Team members with platform access | Collaborate without per-seat surprises |
| **Contact Reveal Credits** | Credits for identifying individual contacts | Control your contact acquisition costs |

:::info Predictable Pricing
Most customers find their costs are 60-80% lower than expected because we only count identified companies, not raw page views.
:::

**Contact sales@abmatic.ai for custom pricing tailored to your traffic volume.**

### What plans are available?

| Plan | Best For | Key Features | Typical Company Size |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Starter** | Teams testing ABM | Company identification, basic personalization, 1 CRM integration | 1-50 employees |
| **Professional** | Growing marketing teams | Full personalization, all CRM integrations, analytics, A/B testing | 50-500 employees |
| **Enterprise** | Large organizations | AI Agents (Alex & Clara), custom limits, dedicated support, SLAs, SSO | 500+ employees |

### Is there a free trial?

**Yes!** Start with a 14-day free trial with full feature access—no credit card required.

| After Your Trial | What Happens |
|------------------|--------------|
| **Continue** | Choose a paid plan and keep all your data |
| **Need more time?** | Request an extension to evaluate further |
| **Not ready?** | Export your data—no pressure, no hard feelings |

### What counts toward my visitor limit?

Your plan counts **unique identified companies per month**—a fair metric that rewards quality over quantity:

| What Counts | What Doesn't Count | Why This Benefits You |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Each unique company identified | Unidentified/anonymous visitors | You don't pay for consumer traffic |
| First visit from a company per month | Page views from identified companies | 100 page views = still 1 company |
| | Return visits from same company | Engaged companies don't cost extra |

**Example:** Acme Corp visits your site 47 times in January, viewing 156 pages. **That's 1 identified company**—not 47 visits or 156 page views.

### What are Contact Reveal credits?

Contact Reveal identifies specific people (not just companies) visiting your site—turning anonymous visitors into actionable leads.

| Plan | Included Credits | Additional Credits |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Starter** | 100/month | Available for purchase |
| **Professional** | 500/month | Discounted bulk packages |
| **Enterprise** | Custom allocation | Volume pricing available |

:::tip Maximize Your Credits
Contact Reveal works best when combined with [Form Tracking](/conversions/form-tracking)—you get contact info for free when visitors fill out forms, saving your credits for anonymous high-value visitors.
