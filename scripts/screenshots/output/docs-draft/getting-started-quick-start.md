## Step 4: Script Installation Page

This critical page shows your unique Abmatic AI tracking script. This JavaScript snippet must be added to your website to enable visitor identification, personalization, and all Abmatic AI features.

Click "Installation" in the bottom of the left sidebar, or navigate to Settings > Script.

Your unique script tag containing your account ID, installation status, and verification timestamp.

### Next Step

Copy the script and add it to your website's <head> section on all pages. After installation, return here to verify it's working properly.

:::tip Marketing Context
THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL STEP. Without this script, Abmatic AI cannot identify visitors or enable any personalization. Make sure your web developer adds this to all pages of your website.
